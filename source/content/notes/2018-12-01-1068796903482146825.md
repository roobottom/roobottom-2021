Disappointed to see that [@getcoconut](https://twitter.com/@getcoconut) are trying to combine accounting and banking for freelancers when thereâ€™s already some really great accounting solutions that many freelancers already use. I think most people would rather a bank with better integrations and a fantastic api.

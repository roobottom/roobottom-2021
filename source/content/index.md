Thanks for visiting my little corner of the web. You've found my personal website where I write about my life; it's probably of limited interest to anyone.

When attempting to be a grownup, I run a small design consultancy called [Roodesign](https://roodesign.co.uk). You should go there if you want user-centred design stuff. 

If you're still here, you may wish to read my [long-form articles](/articles). You probably won't want to read my [diary entries](/diary); they're mainly just about my kids. Failing that, you can have a glance through the [archives](/archives).

Hello, I’m Jon, and this is my website. I’ve been writing here for the last {{ collections.stats.allPosts.timespan }} years, mainly about my personal life, so it’s of little interest to anyone else. 

I live in Littlehampton on Britain’s sunny south coast with my wife, Katie and two children. I call my kids “Roo” and “Rootwo” throughout this site, rather than using their real names.

## The web
I love the web; I’ve made a living designing and building websites. I run a small user-centred design consultancy called [Roodesign](https://roodesign.co.uk). Over the last few years I've been working with the UK government on services for GOV.UK. More recently, I've been mentoring designers and design-leaders. In November 2021, I joined [Made Tech](https://www.madetech.com/) as a UCD principal.

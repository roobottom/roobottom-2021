Hello, I’m Jon, and this is my website. I’ve been writing here for the last {{ collections.stats.allPosts.timespan }} years, mainly about my personal life, so it’s of little interest to anyone else. 

I live in Littlehampton on Britain’s sunny south coast with my wife, Katie and two children. I call my kids “Roo” and “Rootwo” throughout this site, rather than using their real names.

I love the web; I’ve made a living designing and building websites. I also subscribe to the philosophy of the [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/) — all content here is mine, and I can add to or subtract from it at will.
